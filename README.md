# Spaghetti
A small URL-shortener service built with [Rocket](https://rocket.rs) and [Diesel](https://diesel.rs).

### Features
- **(WIP)** Supports many different databases through crate features. (Default is Postgresql)

### Where does the name come from?
Contrary to what you might think, it's not because I expected to write spaghetti code.

When the name was chosen, this was supposed to be a paste service (`Paste => Pasta => Spaghetti`).
The service rapidly changed, but the name did not.
